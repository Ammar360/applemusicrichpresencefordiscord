# AppleMusicRP - Apple Music Discord Rich Presence

**NOTE: There is support for macOS versions before Catalina in 1.1.0 however it is not tested as I do not have access to an Intel Mac...**

A simple and light-weight menu bar application providing Discord Rich Presence support for Apple Music/iTunes on macOS and Windows!

## Highlights

- Light-weight (Uses only 0.5% CPU and less than 40MB of memory on 2020 M1 Macbook Air)
- Easy to install/use, all you need to do is run the app, no configuration required!
- Universal Application on macOS
- Windows support
- Shows time elapsed (How far into the song you are)

## Usage

### Windows (Coming soon)

- Download the latest version (in Releases) and run the exe file! (Make sure Discord is running)
- That's it! You should now see a ðŸŽµ icon in your system tray :)!

### macOS

- Download the latest version (in Releases), double click it, and move the .app "file" to your Applications folder (or wherever you wish.)
- Run it (Make sure Discord is running; If you get an "Unidentified Developer" error, alt+click the application and then click Open.)
- That's it! You should now see a ðŸŽµ icon in your menu bar :)!
