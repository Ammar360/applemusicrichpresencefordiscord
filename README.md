**NOTE: There is support for macOS versions before Catalina in 1.1.0 however it is not tested as I do not have access to an intel mac...**
# AppleMusicRP - Apple Music Discord Rich Presence

A simple and light-weight menu bar application providing Discord Rich Presence support for Apple Music/iTunes! (Currently only for macOS!)

## Highlights
- Light-weight (Uses only 0.5% CPU and less than 40MB of memory on 2020 M1 Macbook Air)
- Easy to install/use, all you need to do is run the app, no configuration required!
- Universal Application
- Shows time elapsed (How far into the song you are)
## Usage

- Download the latest version (in Releases), double click it, and move the .app "file" to your Applications folder (or wherever you wish.)
- Run it (If you get an "Unidentified Developer" error, alt+click the application and then click Open.)
- That's it! You should now see a ðŸŽµ icon in your menu bar :)!
